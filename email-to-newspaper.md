Open Source Ventilator Project - 2200 collaborators so far

## Email Body

Hi there, 

In view of the COVID19 pandemic, we created an open source group to tackle some issues which could be solved by good engineering. 

Feel free to join the slack group and see how things are going, 2200+ members so far, a collection of software developers, engineers and doctors.

We've created some collaborative designs for open sourced ventilators.

I am a Melbournian, and have a keen interest in creating a global pandemic alert system, and have enlisted many developers from this moment to contribute to the effort. We call ourselves the Pandemic Engineers.

Hope TheAge can showcase this effort and can help us to enlist more help for us.

Cheers,
Roy Hui
