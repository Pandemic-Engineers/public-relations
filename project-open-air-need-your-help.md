##Project Open Air Need Your Help in Fighting Covid-19  

Thursday, March 12, 2020   

Project Open Air is tackling the fight against Covid-19 by producing open-sourced, accesible medical devices. We are a community of engineers, developers, and medical experts who are working on providing accesible medical devices, such as open source ventilators, that can be reproduced and assembled locally worldwide. Our aim is to create accesible solutions for 3D-printable ventilators so local communities can print on site. 

Right now we have engineers, PhDs, and the owner of a devices manufacturing company, with a supply chain and offices in New York, Florida, and Taiwan. Although we cannot build ICUs, our team have the capability to help relief the burdened medical front-line in a crisis.

In order for our team to get started, we need digital capacity in scaling our solutions in various cloud platforms for storage and distribution of our solutions.  Some of the platforms we decided to adopt are AWS cloud, Azure, Bandcamp, and JIRA to bring speedy agile development to the community.  We are seeking out other suggestions and help our engineers get started.  

In addition, we are seeking talent to contribute to our open source [Github project](https://github.com/Pandemic-Engineers/).
